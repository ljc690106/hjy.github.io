This histogram shows the number of university buildings constructed over time. The x-axis represents the year buildings were constructed, grouped into 5-year intervals. The y-axis shows how many buildings were built in each time bin. This plot helps identify periods of rapid infrastructure growth, such as construction booms. The data was cleaned by removing missing values in the Year Constructed column and casting it to integers. Altairâ€™s binning functionality was used to group years into intervals for clarity.
