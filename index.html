  <h2>Chart 1: Number of Buildings Constructed (5-Year Intervals)</h2>
  <div id="chart1"></div>
  <script>
    vegaEmbed('#chart1', 'Number of Buildings Constructed Over Time.json');
  </script>
  <p>This chart shows the number of university buildings constructed over time. The x-axis represents the year buildings were constructed, grouped into 5-year intervals. The y-axis shows how many buildings were built in each time bin. This helps identify periods of construction growth.</p>

  <h2> Chart 2: Gross Square Footage by Year (Interactive)</h2>
  <div id="chart2"></div>
  <script>
    vegaEmbed('#chart2', 'Gross SqFt by Year Constructed.json');
  </script>
  <p>This interactive chart allows users to explore the total gross square footage by year of construction. A slider allows highlighting a specific year, helping to pinpoint spikes in building space expansion over time.</p>
