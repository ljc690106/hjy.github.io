  <h2> Chart 1: Total Square Footage by City</h2>
  <div id="chart1"></div>
  <script>
    vegaEmbed('#chart1', 'chart1.json');
  </script>
  <p>
    Chart1 visualizes the total building square footage grouped by city. Each bar represents the total Gross SqFt 
    of all buildings located in that city across the University of Illinois system. We used a basic bar chart 
    encoding with x as the city and y as the total square footage, sorted in descending order for readability. 
    The tooltip helps users quickly see values. Data was grouped using Pandas’ <code>groupby('City')</code> and 
    <code>sum()</code> on Gross SqFt, after dropping missing data.

  <h2> Chart 2: Building Construction Over Time</h2>
  <div id="chart2"></div>
  <script>
    vegaEmbed('#chart2', 'chart2.json');
  </script>
  <p>
    Chart2 shows the number of university buildings constructed over time. The x-axis represents the year buildings 
    were constructed, grouped into 5-year intervals. The y-axis shows how many buildings were built in each time bin. 
    This plot helps identify periods of rapid infrastructure growth, such as construction booms. The data was cleaned 
    by removing missing values in the <code>Year Constructed</code> column and casting it to integers. Altair’s binning 
    functionality was used to group years into intervals for clarity.
